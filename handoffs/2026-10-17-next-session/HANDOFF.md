# Next-session handoff / updated after UI-ray implementation

## User priority

1. Move reward editing from participant Python/script code into the UI. The
   reward is a fixed set of environment signals; UI edits weights and writes
   the reward configuration. Do not silently remove participant control of
   those weights.
2. Let participants choose the number and angles of forward-facing car rays.
   Keep the observation contract/hash honest and memory bounded. Decide and
   document safe count/angle limits before implementation; do not hide limits.

## Current state

The two requested participant controls are now implemented in the working tree:

- UI edits all nine static reward signal weights, validates them to `[-100,100]`,
  writes `reward_config.json`, and records a canonical reward hash.
- UI edits ray count plus ordered angles. Limits: 1–16 unique finite angles,
  `[-90,90]` degrees, and required center ray `0`. Ray order is preserved and
  is part of the observation/config identity.
- UI writes `run_config.json` and `run_identity.json` beside the run.
- Observation contracts and public training manifest now expose ray metadata.
- Scalar/vector custom-ray parity and UI/reward regression tests exist.

- Last committed baseline before this slice: `c82c3a2 feat: start generic participant evaluation boundary`.
- This slice is currently uncommitted; preserve unrelated dirty `.gitignore`,
  Unity, `participant_run/`, and `ui-run/` changes.
- New/changed major-gap files include:
  - `racing_event/model_artifact.py`: safe declarative NumPy MLP artifact loader.
  - `tools/evaluate_participant.py`: generic artifact evaluator CLI.
  - `tools/export_replay.py`: `--artifact-dir` replay path.
  - `racing_event/evaluation.py`: holdout-compatible validation and generic
    artifact evaluation.
  - `tests/test_model_artifact.py` and generic replay tests.
  - `tools/participant_ui.py`: process-group stop supervision and unbuffered
    child output.
  - `racing_event/ppo.py`, `racing_event/observation.py`,
    `tools/run_reference_baseline.py`: atomic writes and bounded reference
    checkpoint recovery work.

## Verification truth

- Before the latest uncommitted changes: `make test` passed 94 Python tests;
  Node replay suite passed 65 tests.
- Current verification: `make test` passed **106 Python tests**; direct Node
  replay suite passed **65 tests**; Python compilation, JS syntax, and targeted
  UI smoke passed. Docker was not run because Docker is unavailable.

## First next steps

1. Inspect/stage only intended changes; do not stage dirty Unity or `.gitignore` edits.
2. Run one longer UI/API smoke and inspect `participant_run/ui-rays-smoke`.
3. Review docs for contradictory “fixed 23-value” or “reward script required” language.
4. Decide whether ray order should remain participant-specified (current behavior)
   or be canonical sorted order; changing it is a contract decision.
5. Finish/commit this slice, then address final ONNX/private evaluator and
   organizer-grade resource enforcement only after decisions/assets exist.

## Important design constraints

- Participant model architecture remains participant-owned. The NumPy MLP is
  only the first safe generic artifact format, not the final ONNX contract.
- Participant reward code must not run in organizer evaluation. The requested
  UI reward editor should produce static weights over the published signal set.
- Ray angles are forward-facing, deterministic, finite, unique, and bounded;
  current implementation preserves participant order because order is part of
  the observation contract. Never allow an unbounded list from the UI.
- Keep `racing_event` internal compatibility identifiers unless a contract
  migration is explicit.
- Local custom-trainer budget enforcement remains cooperative; organizer-grade
  process/resource enforcement is still a separate gap.
- Real browser screenshot validation is unavailable in the container.
